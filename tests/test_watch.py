"""Checks the upstream watch's decisions against stubbed answers.

scripts/check_upstream_release.py streams ISO Open Data's metadata file and
reads ISO's open data page. These tests replace its two network calls,
`_lines` and `_get`, with canned answers built from the extract, so they run
offline. They show what the report says when ISO adds a supplement, changes a
stage, publishes a new edition, drops a record or changes the licence. They
also show it when the network fails, and when an address or an answer is not
one the watch accepts.
